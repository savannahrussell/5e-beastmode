# About this project

This project was made because goodness knows that some things in D&D can be hilariously complex, especially rules as written (RAW). One of those things is the Conjure family of spells, where you can pick from a **wide** variety of things to summon, but all of the tools available don't really offer a way to narrow those choices down. Same thing for Wildshape, where you're free to pick any beast, but nothing exists to help narrow your choices down.

I'm hoping to take all of the available info that I can from the system reference document (SRD) and strip mine it for creating a way to help players and DMs not have to go through quite so many headaches when it comes to managing these spells and abilities.

I don't want to sit through 10 minutes of "what should I pick?" any more, and neither will you, after this project gets off the ground.
